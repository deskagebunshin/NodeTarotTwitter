Wands,1,Ace,Cancer - Leo - Virgo,♋♌♍,,,Kether,,0,"The root of the powers of fire. This card represents the essence of the element of Fire it its inception. solar-phallic outburst of flame from which spring lightnings in every direction. The Tarot Ace of Wands is the essence of the Spirit World of Creativity; the time of Spring and the space of South. The Ace of Wands represents Spiritual self-realization, awakening and is known as the symbol of the uncontainable life-force that's is with-in and all around us; electric microw-waves and yet is shaped and formed by the Abysmal Womb who is magnetism."
Wands,2,Two,Airies,♈,Mars,0 - 10,Chokmah,Dominion,1,"Lord of Dominion and whose zodiacal attribution is Mars in Aries. Mars being the planet of vitality, energy, and assertion: Aries is the astrological symbol of exploration and pioneering."

Represents the Spiritual Integrity, Honesty, that is the Virtue of Spirit, Mind and body, in total agreement.Represents the Spiritual Integrity, Honesty, that is the Virtue of Spirit, Mind and body, in total agreement."
Wands,4,Four,Airies,♈,Venus,20 - 30,Chesed,Completion,1,"Lord of Perfected Works. Venus in Aries, indicates that one's work can't be accomplished without tact and gentleness. Completion and limitation of the original work. Indicates a balance has been maintained by the Original Will without any need to go beyond this limited scope. Limitation is required to make form"
Wands,5,Five,Leo,♌,Saturn,0 - 10,Geburah,Strife,0,"Astrologically the 5 of Wands card is Saturn in Leo. Since Leo is a fire sign, this represents quarreling and strife that comes from an outpouring of force that is both agitated and disturbing. a confusion of ideas and retribution which is the active power of re-balance. a moment of strife in the petty obstacles of life and love where nothing seems to work out right in work or play."
Wands,6,Six,Leo,♌,Jupiter,10 - 20,Tipareth,Victory,1,"definite accomplishment and carrying out of a matter. Success with the result of effort, is the underlying current of all 6's. In the World of energy, Atziluth, this means Victory. Where as in Briah, the World of Pleasure, happiness is a direct result of working for it. In the world of quarreling and Strife, Yetzirah, strife brings success. While, in Assiah, the world of business, and commerce among men, this means material success. THE Thoth 6 OF WANDS-VICTORY: Lord of Victory. Here Jupiter is in the constellation of Leo, and the Angels of the Decan are: Nelokhiel and Yeyayel. In the 6 of Wands, we have the benevolence of Jupiter in the Fiery Sign of Leo (Sun) which brings success and warm relationships. However, it is an aspect that suggest some drama and of victory after great effort."
Wands,7,Seven,Leo,♌,Mars,20 - 30,Netzach,Valour,1,"Astrologically this 7 card represents Mars in Leo. Mars in Leo is a position of courage and strength but a clash is certain, whereas, victory is not. Qabalistically, this card is the influence of Netzach (victory) in Atziluth (World of Pure Spirit). This card is about opposition and possible victory, depending on the amount of courage exercised by the querent. Order, depends on the Valour of the individual, as everyone else, associated with the issue is in chaos."
Wands,8,Eight,Sagitarius,♐,Mercury,0 - 10,Hod,Swiiftmess,1,"The card of high velocity energy. The Thoth 8 of Wands is called SWIFTNESS, and it is attributed to Mercury in the constellation of Sagittarius, making it Swift indeed! Here is represented the ethereal (invisible) aspect of pure fire where all gross-material aspects are removed. Therefore, fire is no longer conjoined with ideas of combustion and incineration. Hence, in the 8 of Wands, fire is represented as energy in its most exalted state and suggest electrical current and/or ""pure light"" in its material sense. Sagittarius represents light as the rainbow and that is shown on the card, as well as electrical current being shown as lightning bolts, throughout the ""as above so below"" design of the cubed diamond."
Wands,9,Nine,Sagitarius,♐,Moon,10 - 20,Yesod,Strength,0,"The Thoth Tarot- 9 of Wands: STRENGTH. 9 is also the number of Yesod (Foundation) on the Tree of Life which brings energy back into balance. Therefore, the equal balance of the Male-electric and the Female-magnetic in our Mind, body and Soul, is a complete tensile Strength that cannot be defeated. Since, astrologically this card is Moon in Sagittarius, the Lunar powers of reflection and illusion acquire great strength in Sagittarius which is a double sided coin."
Wands,10,Ten,Sagitarius,♐,Saturn,20 - 30,Malkuth,Oppression,1,"Culminating, completed Force; Astrologically, this tarot card represents Saturn in the constellation of Sagittarius, amplifying the destructive power of Saturn with the swiftness of Sagittarius. Qabalistically, the Tarot 10 of Wands is symbolic of the influence of Malkuth (Kingdom of Earth) in Atziluth (World of Pure Spirit) leading to material force selfishly applied. Pure Spirit is Pure Mind, and as many of us know Pure Mind is without empathy, so force is applied without concern over ""collateral damage""."
Wands,11,Knight,Scorpio - Sagitarius,♏♐,,20 - 20,,,0,"Fire OF Fire. The Lord of the Flame and the Lightning, The King of the Spirits of Fire King of the Salamanders. The Knight or King of Wands is the motive force behind the Alchemical Fire or Primal Fire (The Thoth Knight, carries the same wand as the Ace of Wands to illustrate this point) on the Qabalistic Tree of Life. This is a fiery personality with great motivational ability. Old perceptions are being destroyed as fuel on this fire, so that new extended and liberated perspective gives birth to spiritual insight. You may call this positive male-power, as in electrical polarity, that forms a swift and occasionally violent personality with the capacity to accomplish long-term goals and handling extremely complex situations but is most often fierce, impetuous, impulsive and tends to act unpredictably."
Wands,12,Queen,Pisces - Aries,♓♈,,20 - 20 ,,,1,"Water of fire The Queen of the Thrones of Flame; Queen of the Salamanders. Represents the spiritual self-discoverer/ the knower of self. This Queenly Archetype, is a personality that lives the axiom of the Qabala and its' tarot cards, ""Above all things, know thyself"". The Queen of Wands card symbolizes the Specific Water in the World of Fire (Consciousness in Spirit). the mysteries of the Watery part of Fire ; the part that flows and waves as water. What can be simply said here, is that Fire is Spirit and the Watery part of Spirit is ""spiritual intelligence"" or the Conscious Spirit"
Wands,13,Prince,Cancer - Leo,♋♌,,20 - 20,,,1,"Air of Fire. The Prince of the Chariot of Fire; Prince and Emperor of the Salamanders. He is romantic especially in matters of history and tradition, to the point of folly, and may engineer ""stunts"" or play elaborate practical jokes. He is often violent, especially in the expression of an opinion, but he does not necessarily hold the opinion about which he is so emphatic... His character is intensely noble and generous. He may be an extravagant boaster. while slyly laughing both at the object of his boast and at himself for making it..it... His courage is fanatically strong, and his endurance indefatigable. He is always fighting against odds, and always wins in the long the very long--run. it's a dynamic ""rockin' "" card! The Prince of Wands is the Principle of Mastery of inspired creativity! The Prince Of Wands, represents the Sun Warrior not only does he represent swiftness, strength, brilliance and agility, he is also the paradigm of dynamic mastery of unlimited creative expression from deep ""within""; from the Universal Source. He is a Prometheus, a Titan of Fiery Creation. The causally thrown reins over his wrist, symbolizes the inspired creativity that is not held back and is free to manifest and express itself. The Solar Lion freely pulling the Chariot, symbolizes self trust in letting the creative process flow, without restriction nor restraint. The contained fire in the chariot, is focused concentration and attention to manifest one's creativity that comes from above (The chariot is coming down from the heavens)."
Wands,14,Princess,Cancer - Leo - Virgo,♋♌♍,,,,,1,"Earth of fire. Original Titles: The Princess of the Shining Flame; The Rose of the Palace of Fire; Princess and Empress of the Salamanders. THE PRINCESS OF WANDS: represents the Earthly part of Fire. She is the expression of the irresistible action of a combustible substance and rules from the Heavens from one quadrant around the North Pole (She=Magnetic Force). It is interesting to note, that the Female Force gives Form to the Fiery-electric male force, which in its primeval stage, as the Ace of Wands, is unwilled, unformed and indirect. But like the Magnetic Field of Earth, giving form to the Solar rays, not unlike the Aurora in the night sky, She justifies the direction of this male Force."
Cups,1,Ace,Libra - Scorpio - Sagitarius,♎♏♐,,,Kether,,1,"The root of the powers of the water. Is Kether in Briah, the Creative World, depicting the influence of Kether on the Mental Level. The Ace of Cups is the Root Powers of Water, an element used to symbolize the Unconsciousness and emotions when in combination with Fire, which is known as Water's Consort. the wave action characteristic of physical water implying the activity that encloses and directs pure consciousness, as the Womb of consciousness is the Universal Collective Unconscious and/or The Divine Creative. As the Universe of Energy is woven out of waves of consciousness, and/or ideas that are understood. "
Cups,2,Two,Cancer,♋,Venus,0 - 10,Chokmah,Love,0,"This card might really be renamed the Lord of Love under Will for that is its full and true meaning. It shows the harmony of the male and the female: interpreted in the largest sense. It is perfect and placid harmony, radiating a intensity of joy and ecstasy."
Cups,3,Three,Cancer,♋,Mercury,10 - 20,Binah,Abundance,0,"Emotional abundance, joy, celebration, and sharing the wonder of life. This is a sharing experience and can represent the flowing of love and positive feeling. Sharing pleasure together, having fun with others. Mercury, is the symbol of communication. Cancer, is the ability to communicate the emotional feelings one has especially the nurturing, loving, and light feelings one has as represented by the golden lotus blossoms spraying the ""pollen of golden light"", or the Night Sun's Water into the pomegranate cups."
Cups,4,Four,Cancer,♋,Moon,20 - 30,Chesed,Luxury,0,"Lord of Blended Pleasure. four is Chesed, the sphere of generous, expan-sive, and beneficent Jupiter. Jupiter is exalted in Cancer, and Cancer is ruled by the Moon. Can the components of one card get any cozier? No, but, in this case, familiarity is starting to breed contempt and eventually enough will be enough. an abandonment to desire, causing one to overly fantasize. Like the Demiurge itself, the Four of Cups, in its self-absorbed arrogance, thinks Luxury is the god of the suit of Cups all the while never dreaming that it owes its very existence to the sublime true gods of the supernal triad, the Ace, Two, and Three of Cups."
Cups,5,Five,Scorpio,♏,Mars,0 - 10,Geburah,Disappointment,1,"Lord of loss in pleasure. However, the powerful masculine-expressive aspect of Mars ruling Scorpio, slows down the putrefaction so that it is internal and not external, frustrating the anticipated pleasure that is emotionally sought. But it still looks good, so we think there is something wrong with ourselves, rather than the goal."
Cups,6,Six,Scorpio,♏,Sol,10 - 20,Tipareth,Pleasure,1,"The Sun is outrageously happy to be in Tiphareth and shines on the uble warmth and pleasantness on the sensuous and fun-loving side of Scorpio. Pleasure, in the title of this card, must be understood in its highest sense: it implies well-being, harmony of natural forces without effort or strain, ease, satisfaction. Foreign to the idea of the card is the gratification of natural or artificial desires. Yet it does represent emphatically the fulfillment of the sexual Will, as shown by the ruling Sephira, planet, element, and sign. "
Cups,7,Seven,Scorpio,♏,Venus,20 - 30,Netzach,Debauch,0,"Lord of Illusionary Success. This is one of the worst ideas that one can have; its mode is poison, its goal madness. It represents the delusion of Delirium Tremens and drug addic-tion; it represents the sinking into the mire of false pleasure. There is something almost suicidal in this card. Venus represents love and beauty but is all superficial, while inside, Venus is corrupted with thoughts of vanity etc., while Scorpio represents transformation and deep-emotional exploration and is noted for ""its deep inner secret life"". The clash of emotion is apparent in this union. Since, Venus is in the zodiacal sign of Scorpio, it's creating a very intense and emotional presence that is often involved in deceit."
Cups,8,Eight,Pisces,♓,Saturn,0 - 10,Hod,Indolence,0,"Lord of Abandoned success. This card represents a party for which all preparations have been made; but the host has forgotten to invite the guests; or the caterers have not delivered the good cheer. There is this difference, though, that it is in some way or other the host's own fault. The number 8 is associated with Hod (splendor) on the Tree of Life and shows the influence of Mercury which would seem all well and good until we realize that on this card the planet Saturn is in the house of Pisces. Pisces is calm but stagnant water/Emotion; and the heavy lead influence of Saturn poisons it completely."
Cups,9,Nine,Pisces,♓,Jupiter,10 - 20,Yesod,Happiness,0,"Lord of material happiness. Pisces, being the mutable sign of water, tends to stabilize the element. She is most welcome in Yesod, the sphere of the watery Moon. Yesod is also the Foundation, the sephira that stabilizes the entire Tree of Life. This provides a most cozy and satisfying environment for loveable Jupiter to happily enjoy the good life as only Jupiter and his friends can."
Cups,10,Ten,Pisces,♓,Mars,20 - 30,Malkuth,Satiety,1,"Lord of perfected happiness. There is something very sinister about this card. It suggests the morbid hunger which springs from sur-feit. The craving of a drug addict is the idea. At the same time, of course, it is this final agony of descent into illusion which renders necessary the completion of the circle by awakening the Eld of the All-Father. Mars is the gross, violent and disruptive force which inevitably attacks every supposed perfection. His energy displays the greatest possible contrast with that of Pisces, which is both peaceful and spiritualized."
Cups,11,Knight,Aquarius - Pisces,♒♓,,20 - 20,,,1,"fire of water. Lord of the Waves and the Waters; The King of the Hosts of the Sea; King of Nymphs or Undines. Swiftness and violence ill suit a character naturally placid; it is rare indeed to meet a person who has succeeded in harmonizing these conflicting elements. However, the fiery part of water is the Power of Solution. Hence, The Knight of Cups is not unlike the fiery attack of rain or springs."
Cups,12,Queen,Gemini - Cancer,♊♋,,20 - 20 ,,,0,"water of water. The Queen of the Thrones of Water; Queen of the Nymphs or Undines. Specific Water in the World of Primal Water. a ""womb-with-a -view"", Imagination, who is the expression of emotional authenticity and congruity about motherhood issues and issues surrounding maternal or female authority figures in one's life. She does not use feelings to attack nor does she feel the need to apologize for her feelings. Water of water is tantamount to saying reflection of reflection, or mirror to mirror. The Queen of Cups is popular and makes friends easily because, when others look at her, they see only themselves. Crowleys tells us that ""She is the perfect agent and patient, able to receive and transmit everything without herself being affected thereby?"
Cups,13,Prince,Libra - Scorpio,♎♏,,20 - 20,,,1,"air of water. The Prince of the Chariot of the Waters: Prince and Emperor of the Nymphs or Undines. Libra passing over to Scorpio is a very strong moment, but the active characteristics of air in the passive environment of water makes an uneasy combination. Like foaming bubbles exploding from an underchilled bottle of champagne, these two elements do not care if they ruin the party or the furniture; they just want to get out and away from each other. Maybe that is why Crowley describes the Prince of Cups as ""completely without conscience in the ordinary sense of the word, and is therefore usually distrusted by his neighbors."" He, this Son of the Divine Creative, is the lover within each individual that expresses and experiences ""hard desire"" which simply means deep emotional passion---the kind that created all things"
Cups,14,Princess,Libra - Scorpio - Sagitarius,♎♏♐,,,,,1,"earth of water. The Princess of the Waters; Lotus of the Palace of the Floods; Princess and Empress of the Nymphs or Undines. The character of the Princess is infinitely gracious. All sweetness, all volup-tuousness, gentleness, kindness and tenderness are in her character. She lives in the world of Romance, in the perpetual dream of rapture. Superficially, she seems selfish, and indolent, but this is not so. She just goes about her work silently and effortlessly with no need to consult others but always willing to assist. The Earthly part of Water (Life-Fluid), in particular, the faculty of crystallization."
Swords,1,Ace,Caricorn - Aquarius - Pisces,♑♒♓,,,Kether,,1,"The Ace of Swords is the primordial Energy of Air, the Essence of the Vau of the Tetragrammaton, the integration of the Ruach. The Ace of Swords is the root of the element air and represents the Ruach. Ruach is the intellect part of the soul, and (according to Eastern mystics) the mind is the great enemy. The mind violently resists identification with any higher levels of consciousness. Consequently, from out of the mind springs conflict, frustration, anxiety, worry, and sorrow. Is it any wonder the suit of Swords is filled with so many unpleasant cards? However, in the proper hands, the sword can be the weapon that cuts through the crap, and the Ace of Swords is the sword of the Magus."
Swords,2,Two,Libra,♎,Moon,0 - 10,Chokmah,Peace,1,"Lord of peace restored. Astrologers tell us that people who were born with Moon in Libra criticize and make judgments from a position of enviable equilibrium. They weigh every problem and proposition with the utmost fairness. This fortunate union of sign and planet finds a predictably dignified home in Chokmah, it seems we've dodged a bullet. We must diways remember, however, that for the sharp and dangerous sword, peace is just an uncharacteristic and temporary interruption from war."
Swords,3,Three,Libra,♎,Saturn,10 - 20,Binah,Sorrow,1,"Lord of sorrow. In this abstract atmosphere, there are no things or even forms of things nothing but pure potential. The ""sorrow"" of this card is not the same kind of sorrow evoked by, say, the death of a loved one or the loss of a lover. It is a profound state of consciousness that, from our below-the-abyss point of view, we can only attempt to describe. Sorrow falls pitifully short of an accurate description, but it is probably the best word the English language can offer us.Without forms or reason, the mind must give way to a consciousness higher than itself. The Three of Swords represents the wondrous trance of sorrow that first enlightened the Buddha. We should all be so lucky to draw Sorrow from the deck."
Swords,4,Four,Libra,♎,Jupiter,20 - 30,Chesed,Truce,0,"Lord of rest from strife. Chesed is the sphere of Jupiter and serves as a gracious but authoritative host to Jupiter in Libra. Equilibrium and justice are definitely key words for this card, but Crowley tells us that it also brings with it the ""establishment of dogma, and the law concerning it.” Swords are weapons, and weapons discharge their design by virtue of the disciplines of war, not of peace. The kind of""truce"" the Four of Swords mon-tors is a peace enforced by the threat of violence, and as such will be short lived. It is the concord of conformity and compromise, however, that characterizes a culture that would rather blindly surrender to authority than to face the challenges of liberty."
Swords,5,Five,Aquarius,♒,Venus,0 - 10,Geburah,Defeat,1,"Lord of defeat. Venus rules Aquarius and, for a moment, she is very happy to have him as her date. After all, they're both pacifists. They are a friendly, mellow, and sentimental couple. Unfortunately, this sensitive pair has shown up at the wrong party. A terrible fight has broken out in a very rough and well-armed area of Qabalahville Geburah, the house of Mars, which is located in Yetzirah (the world of Swords). Naturally, Venus and Aquarius volunteer to be peacemakers, but they are just too nice, too peaceful, too weak to handle themselves in this violent neighborhood. The inevitable result is Defeat."
Swords,6,Six,Aquarius,♒,Mercury,10 - 20,Tipareth,Science,1,"Lord of earned Success.being. The conservative beauty of this card announces that the shining balance of Tiphareth brings a much-needed measure of nobility and clear-headedness to the sit of Swords. The formula that creates the character of this card couldn't be more auspicious for the suit of Swords. In the human soul, the counterpart of Yetzirah is the Ruach, or the intellect. On the Tree of Life, the center of the Ruach radiates from Tiphareth. Finally, an air planet, Mercury, finds itself in the fixed air sign of Aquarius. Someone with Mercury in Aquarius in his or her natal horoscope is said to have a keen, analytical mind and an extraordinary ability to concentrate. He or she is also intensely curious and enjoys examining both sides of a question. Sounds like a scientist, doesn't it?"
Swords,7,Seven,Aquarius,♒,Moon,20 - 30,Netzach,Futility,1,"Lord of Unstable Effort. There are, embedded complexities in our formula that relieve this card of some of ore tortuous burdens that afflict the other sevens. For example, the very name seventh sephira is Victory. This may seem like grasping at straws, but Swords resonate well to words like victory. The Moon in Aquarius adds elements of change the possibility of compromise. Crowley observes: ""It is like a rheumatic boxer to ""come back"" after being out of the ring for years."" Nonetheless, it is well ember that, sometimes, even old boxers get in a lucky punch. I wouldn’t bet on it"
Swords,8,Eight,Gemini,♊,Jupiter,0 - 10,Hod,Interferance,1,"Lord of shortened forces. Actually, this card is not as bad as it looks or its title implies. Jupiter in Gemini indicates an element of luck in intellectual pursuits. Hod is the sphere of Mercury, to rules Gemini. As it does to the eights of the other suits, however, Hod's imbalanced and lowly position on the Tree of Life throws a wet blanket on what otherwise might have been a fortunate coupling. There is not enough Mercurial energy left to t up much of a fight, and in the suit of Swords, fighting is what it is all about. Cowley says, ""the Will is constantly thwarted by accidental interference."" The Eight of Swords does not show us much patience or persistence. If it’s influence is to be overcome, those qualities will need to be developed and introduced into equation. Otherwise, everything will most definitely serve to interfere."
Swords,9,Nine,Gemini,♊,Mars,10 - 20,Yesod,Cruelty,0,"Lord of despair and cruelty. Oh, dear Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition! The whole scene induces dizziness. I can almost taste the drops of rusty blood drip-"
Swords,10,Ten,Gemini,♊,Sol,20 - 30,Malkuth,Ruin,1,"ping from the swords. This kind of a surprise to find this horrible mess in middle-pillar Yesod. After all the other nines are perfectly lovely fellows. But even the balance and stability of Yesod can't come to the rescue of all-action Mars, in all-talk Gemini, in the lowest burned-out region of Yetzirah, the world of thought. Watch out! It is ""agony of mind."""
Swords,11,Knight,Taurus - Gemini,♉♊,,20 - 20,,,1,"The Lord of the Winds and Breezes; King of the Spirits of Air; King of the Sylphs and Sylphides. Fire of air, suggestive of a violent wind. The general divinatory meaning of the card can be summed up in one word--attack. ""The moral qualities of person thus indicated,"" Crowley warned, ""are activity and skill, subtlety and cleverness. He is fierce, delicate and courageous but altogether the prey of his idea, which comes to him as an inspiration without reflection. """
Swords,12,Queen,Virgo - Libra,♍♎,,20 - 20 ,,,1,"Water of air. The Queen of the Thrones of Air, Queen of the Sylphs and Sylphides. Water of Air. The suit of Swords represents Yetzirah, the formative world- the minds gr of deity. Swords' and Yetzirah's counterpart in the human soul is the Ruach, the intellect, which is centered in the brain--the human head. Using the sword ofdis cretion and reason, the Queen has separated the higher faculties of the intel from the influences of the lower nature (the Nephesh, the animal soul). She is quie literally, Crowley points out, the ""Liberator of the Mind."" The influence of Virgo moving into Libra gives the Queen of Swords the practicality and grace of a great monarch. This native ""should be intensely perceptive, a keen observer, a subtle interpreter, an intense individualist, swift and accurate at recording ideas, in action confident, in spirit gracious and just. Her movements will be graceful, and her ability in dancing and balancing exceptional."" If ill-dignified, she can be as cruel and dangerous as she looks."
Swords,13,Prince,Capricorn - Aquarius,♑♒,,20 - 20,,,0,"Air of Air. The Prince of the Chariot of the Winds; Prince and Emperor of Sylphs and Sylphides. Like a madman whose brain creates only to destroy, we see the Prince with the sword in his right hand, with which he creates ideas and images, and the sickle in his left hand, with which he immediately cuts them down. This sounds like mad. ness, but we are doing the same thing every moment of our waking lives. When the mind is given a creative outlet for this process, such as music, literature, or film making, we discover great genius. Crowley heaps great praise upon the pure intelligence of the Prince of Swords, hurt he cannot avoid discussing the futility of thinking about thinking. ""He is full of ideas and designs which tumble over each other,"" he points out. ""He is a mass of fine ideal unrelated to practical effort.'"
Swords,14,Princess,Capricorn - Aquarius - Pisces,♑♒♓,,,,,1,"Earth of air. The Princess of the Rushing Winds; The Lotus of the Palace of Air; Princess and Empress of the Sylphs and Sylphides. Throne of the Ace of Swords. The character of the Princess is stern and revengeful. Her logic is destruc-tive. She is firm and aggressive, with great practical wisdom and subtlety in material things. She shews great cleverness and dexterity in the management of practical affairs, especially where they are of a controversial nature. She is very adroit in the settlement of controversies,For if we were to gaze upon its awful face, we would surely be turned to stone. Turning things to stone (""Fixation of the volatile""-""materialization of Idea”) is just part of the job description for Princess of Swords, however.This is why the Eastern mystics warn us that the mind is a great enemy. It must be defeated in battle. When the battle begins, the Ruach naturally sends its finest swordswoman into the field- a warrior-princess who manifests everything that is inherent, yet hidden, in her lord, the ace, a mighty champion of the mind--a Minerva, an Artemis, a Valkyrie, - the Princess of Swords."
Disks,1,Ace,Aries - Taurus - Gemini,♈♉♊,,,Kether,,1,
Disks,2,Two,Capricorn,♑,Jupiter,0 - 10,Chokmah,Change,0,"Lord of harmonious change. Jupiter in Capricorn. Infinite circle that encloses the universe. CHANGE represents a very important understanding of the motion of Conscious Energy in building and maintaining life and the second law of thermodynamics where ""...everything proceeds from order to disorder"". Change is the constant that the keeps energy moving. Hence, The Thoth 2 of Disks-Change, is representative of the dual change of inner and outer self and/or cause and effect. Uroboros (Oriental symbol of infinity), the snake that eats its own tail, symbolizes the consistency of cyclic change, as organic matter eats itself to stay alive. Although, on an individual scale, change is often seemingly negative, it is however, the positive Universal constant that keeps energy moving. This card is the picture of the complete manifested Universe. It represents the first manifestation of earth, the throne of spirit, so we have completed a great cosmic circuit. Hence, the card manifests the symbolism of the serpent of the endless band. Even though Jupiter and Capricorn are not usually happy with each other, this high up on the Tree of Life, their differences are more or less forgiven."
Disks,3,Three,Capricorn,♑,Mars,10 - 20,Binah,Morphogenesis,1,"The lord of material works. Mars in Capricorn. The 3 of Disks-Works represents endurance, strong physical determination, and tenacity. The 3, is the ability to give the ""works"" to what you want. In it's mundane interpretation, the 3 of Disks is the card of nobility; that of trade, skilled labor, renown and glory. The Three of Disks is the material heart of the three-stroke engine that drives the universe. The material establishment of the idea of the Universe, the determination of its basic form. Eternal universe sustaining competition. It is work or works and is the least abstract of the lower disks,"
Disks,4,Four,Capricorn,♑,Sol,20 - 30,Chesed,Power,1,"Lord of Earthly Power. Sun in Capricorn. The 4 of Disks is representative of the Rational Mind in total control of creative energy for material wealth; boundaries against change are erected and the illusion of security is enjoyed. Condition of assured material gain, and earthly power completed but nothing beyond. Held by constant authority and vigilance, a type of Law and order holds the 4 Alchemical Elements in balance. Fire (Energy), Air (mind), Water (emotions), and Earth (physical), are all centered on material security. obtaining material security often means ""nothing ventured nothing gained"" and without venture one's situation becomes a problem of stasis that will be removed by the Greater Spiritual Self (""A Tower Moment"") to keep things moving. For now things look under control and sitting back and enjoying material security seems justified. Here we also have gift, legacy and inheritance."
Disks,5,Five,Taurus,♉,Mercury,0 - 10,Geburah,Worry,0,"Lord of Material Trouble. Mercury in Taurus. this card represents physical worry, concerns, and rumination. It is a state of being that dwells in the past and goes forward fearing the future and therefore doesn't live in the now. By not living in the now, we are not present today, which doesn't allow new perspectives or thoughts to change our mental emotional direction. This is a general effect of a long strain without action; a general state of inaction. Health, finances, work, relationships and/or creativity are the concerns here."
Disks,6,Six,Taurus,♉,Moon,10 - 20,Tipareth,Success,0,"The Lord of success. Moon in Taurus. The six of Disks card represents physical attainment, accomplishment and success. This is the harmonious energy of Earth, the balance of polarities have made fruitful the Son, Father, and Grandfather aspects of electric force and the Maid, Mother, and Crone aspects of magnetic force. It is important to remember that this is earth, and gravitational forces will pull this successful creation down into itself, where everything becomes slow and heavy; therefore, this success is temporary but enjoyable just the same. there is a great beauty here that comes from the balances of mental, emotional, and physical energy enhanced by the higher conscious states of self. Generosity is shown here, as you now have enough success in physical health, finances, and emotional balance to assist others in their success. "
